# Let's Predict Churn!
  
Project Description: 
Customers are churning at an alarming rate at a telco company and they need our help finding out why!  Since it is more cost effective to keep our current customers, than recruit new ones, we will focus on determining what is driving our current customers away.  Our goal is to use machine learning to determine which customers have a higher probability of leaving us.  It is important to find which customers might leave us because by retaining our current customers we can increase our revenue.
